# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) System Integration

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This module covers integrating voice command processing with LLM-based task decomposition and multi-modal fusion for end-to-end humanoid control.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Integrate Whisper for voice command processing in ROS 2
- Apply LLM prompt engineering for task decomposition
- Implement multi-modal fusion for vision grounding with language instructions
- Build an end-to-end VLA system for humanoid robots
- Verify the complete system with natural language commands

## Topics Covered

- [Whisper Integration with ROS 2](./whisper-ros2)
- [LLM Prompt Engineering](./llm-prompt-engineering)
- [Multi-Modal Fusion](./multimodal-fusion)
- [VLA System Verification](./vla-system-verification)
- [Capstone Project Integration](./capstone-project)

This capstone module brings together all previous learning into a sophisticated AI system for the complete autonomous humanoid project.
