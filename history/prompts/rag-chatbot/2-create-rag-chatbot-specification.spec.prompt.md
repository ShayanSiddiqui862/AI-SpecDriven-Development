## Project: Next.js/FastAPI RAG Chatbot using ChatKit SDKs (Constraint-Specific)

**Target Components:** Next.js (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), Qdrant Cloud (Vector DB), OpenAI Agent/ChatKit SDKs.(All documentation must be accesesed  from context-7-Mcp)
**Data Source:** Markdown files located in the project's `/docs` folder (the book content)

### 1. Data Ingestion Pipeline (Python Script - Constraint-Specific)

| Spec ID | Requirement | Detail | Key Metric/Tool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DIP.1** | **Content Processing** | The Markdown source files from `/docs` must be processed by the **`context7-Mcp`** utility to standardize chunking and metadata extraction *before* embedding. | Pre-processor: `context7-Mcp` |
| **DIP.2** | **Embedding Model** | Use the sentence-transformers `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model to generate embeddings for all chunks generated by **`context7-Mcp`**. | Vector Dimension: 1536 |
| **DIP.3** | **Qdrant Indexing Method** | The final vectors and chunks must be uploaded to the Qdrant collection *exclusively* through the **`qdrant-mcp-server`** interface, not directly via `qdrant-client`. | nd the information in the book's content." | Agent System Prompt (Text) |

### 3. Next.js Frontend (Next.js & ChatKit.js - Constraint-Specific)

| Spec ID | Requirement | Detail | Key Metric/Tool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FES.1** | **Framework & Source** | The frontend must be built using **Next.js**. The displayed content is the embedded Next.js documentation. | Next.js (App Router preferred) |
| **FES.2** | **Book Displaying**| The book must be displayed on frontend using /AI-book endpoint on frontend.
| **FES.3** | **Chat InterfaceIndexing Server: `qdrant-mcp-server` |
| **DIP.4** | **Qdrant Indexing Detail** | Create a persistent collection in Qdrant Cloud Free Tier. Ensure metadata includes the section/chapter information (as provided by `context7-Mcp`) for filtering flexibility. | Collection Name: `book_content`, Client: `qdrant-mcp-server` wrapper |

### 2. RAG Backend Service (FastAPI & OpenAI Agents/ChatKit)

| Spec ID | Requirement | Detail | Key Metric/Tool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RBS.1** | **Framework & SDK** | Build the backend API using FastAPI and the **OpenAI Agent SDK** for RAG orchestration. | Python 3.10+, FastAPI, `openai` Python SDK |
| **RBS.2** | **ChatKit Session Endpoint** | Implement an endpoint to create a new ChatKit session, returning the `client_secret` to the Next.js frontend for secure communication. | `POST /api/chatkit/session` |
| **RBS.3** | **RAG Tool Implementation** | Create a custom **Agent Tool** that handles retrieval. The tool must interface with Qdrant (through its client, assuming t** | Embed the chat widget using the **ChatKit.js SDK**. | ChatKit React Component | Must be available to all frontend endpoint
| **FES.4** | **Text Selection Logic** | Implement a global event listener to capture the text selected by the user specifically within the book content sections. | JavaScript `window.getSelection().toString()` |
| **FES.5** | **Contextual Query Mechanism** | The frontend must send the selected text as a required auxiliary parameter (`selected_text`) in the payload to the Agent Tool when a question is submitted, enabling the **RBS.4** logic. | Input Payload structure: `{ message: string, selected_text: string | null }` |
| **FES.6** | **CORS Configuration** | Ensure the Next.js application can successfully make API calls to the deployed FastAPI service. | API Call Verification (Local & Production) |
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification document for the Next.js/FastAPI RAG Chatbot project, organizing requirements into clear sections with proper IDs, requirements, details, and key metrics/tools. The specification covers data ingestion pipeline (DIP.1-DIP.4), RAG backend service (RBS.1-RBS.4), and Next.js frontend requirements (FES.1-FES.6), along with acceptance criteria, constraints, and out-of-scope items.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete feature specification document created for RAG chatbot system
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/rag-chatbot/spec.md, history/prompts/rag-chatbot/2-create-rag-chatbot-specification.spec.prompt.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan to create implementation plan, /sp.tasks to break down implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Organized fragmented requirements into structured specification with clear sections and traceability

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Original user input was fragmented with command outputs mixed in, required careful parsing of requirements
- Graders run and results: N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Implement a validation step to ensure all requirement fragments are properly understood before specification creation
