# Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This comprehensive guide covers the essential concepts and practical implementations needed to understand and develop humanoid robotics systems using modern AI techniques.

## Course Overview

This textbook is structured around four core modules:

1. **ROS 2 Humanoid Control** - Learn to create and control simulated humanoid joints using ROS 2
2. **Digital Twin Environment Setup** - Build high-fidelity simulated environments with Gazebo and Unity
3. **AI-Robot Brain Development** - Deploy NVIDIA Isaac Sim and implement VSLAM and Nav2 for navigation
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) System Integration** - Create end-to-end systems that execute natural language commands

Each module builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive learning path from basic ROS 2 concepts to advanced VLA integration.
