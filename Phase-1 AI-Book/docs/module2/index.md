# Module 2: Digital Twin Environment Setup

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This module covers creating high-fidelity simulated environments for robot development and testing.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Build Gazebo worlds with accurate physics properties
- Convert URDF models to SDF for simulation
- Implement sensor simulation for realistic data generation
- Set up Unity integration for human-robot interaction
- Verify simulated environments with physics and interactive objects

## Topics Covered

- [Gazebo World Building](./gazebo-worlds)
- [URDF-to-SDF Conversion](./urdf-to-sdf)
- [Sensor Simulation](./sensor-simulation)
- [Unity Human-Robot Interaction](./unity-hri)
- [Verification and Testing](./verification)

This module builds on Module 1 and prepares students for the AI-robot brain development in Module 3.
