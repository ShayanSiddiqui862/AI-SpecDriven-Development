Textbook: "Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course"

Target Audience: University instructors teaching capstone robotics courses, graduate students specializing in embodied AI, and robotics engineers transitioning to humanoid systems. Assumes foundation in AI/ML and basic robotics concepts.

Primary Focus: Creating a production-ready, implementation-driven textbook that delivers on the promise of "AI Systems in the Physical World" through hands-on modules using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA integration.

Core Success Criteria:

Module Completion: All 4 modules must have fully implementable tutorials with working code

Hardware Transparency: Clear guidance on required computational resources (RTX workstations, Jetson kits, robots) with budget alternatives

Capstone Deliverable: Complete, step-by-step guide to building the "Autonomous Humanoid" that responds to voice commands, plans, navigates, and manipulates

Academic Rigor: Peer-reviewed citations for all theoretical concepts while maintaining practical focus

Deployment Ready: All content must generate a aining

Hardware-accelerated VSLAM implementation with RealSense data

Nav2 configuration for bipedal path planning (dynamic stability considerations)

Deliverable: Object detection and navigation stack running in Isaac Sim

Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Whisper integration for voice command processing in ROS 2

LLM prompt engineering for task decomposition ("Clean the room" -> ROS action sequence)

Multi-modal fusion: Vision grounding with language instructions

Capstone integration: End-to-end pipeline from voice to physical action

Deliverable: Full VLA system where simulated robot executes complex natural language commands
