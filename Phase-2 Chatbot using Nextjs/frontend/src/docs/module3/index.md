# Module 3: AI-Robot Brain Development

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This module covers deploying NVIDIA Isaac Sim and implementing perception and navigation systems for humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Deploy Isaac Sim Omniverse on RTX workstations
- Generate synthetic data for perception training
- Implement hardware-accelerated VSLAM with RealSense data
- Configure Nav2 for bipedal path planning with dynamic stability
- Verify object detection and navigation stacks in Isaac Sim

## Topics Covered

- [Isaac Sim Deployment](./isaac-sim-deployment)
- [Synthetic Data Generation](./synthetic-data-generation)
- [VSLAM Implementation](./vslam-implementation)
- [Nav2 Bipedal Configuration](./nav2-bipedal-config)
- [Perception and Navigation Validation](./perception-navigation-validation)

This module builds on the digital twin environment from Module 2 and prepares students for the Vision-Language-Action integration in Module 4.
