# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-05
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md]

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - *Note: Technology-specific details are integral to this textbook specification.*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - *Note: Language is technical, appropriate for the target audience.*
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - *Note: Technology-specific details are integral to this textbook specification.*
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - *Note: Technology-specific details are integral to this textbook specification.*

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
- The specification, while technically containing implementation details (specific tools, versions, hardware), is deemed appropriate for its context as a "Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course" textbook specification. These details are integral to the domain.
- The language is highly technical, which is appropriate for the target audience (university instructors, graduate students, robotics engineers) but not strictly for non-technical stakeholders.
- The clarification regarding "How does the system manage multiple concurrent voice commands or conflicting instructions?" was deferred due to the 3-question limit, as its impact was deemed slightly lower than the other three foundational clarifications.
