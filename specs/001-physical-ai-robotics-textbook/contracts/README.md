# API Contracts for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

This project focuses on generating a Docusaurus-based textbook, with all documentation content, structure, and deployment managed exclusively through the `context7` MCP server. Therefore, no *new* API contracts are being designed or implemented as part of this feature.

All interactions for content management, site generation, and deployment will leverage the existing APIs and functionalities provided by the `context7` MCP server. This adheres to the core implementation mandate of a "100% context7 MCP implementation." The `context7` MCP server acts as the authoritative interface for managing the Docusaurus project lifecycle.
